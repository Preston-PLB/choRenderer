# choRenderer
This is the module that will be used to render out images for chord charts in propresenter7

## What does this do?

This cho renderer go module takes a Chord Pro file and cuts it up into seperate PNG files for each section denoted by a {Comment: "*"} tag.

## But Why?

Because I needed a way to elegantly display chord charts on a stage display using pro presenter 7

## Is there going to be an easy yo use client for this?

I hope so... I hope so...
